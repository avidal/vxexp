# vxexp

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/avidal/vxexp.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/avidal/vxexp)

vxexp is a collection of experimental widgets and utility functions for the [dank] terminal UI
library [vaxis/vxfw] by [rockorager].

**NOTE: This is not an official repository. There is no stability guarantee, nor is there
a guarantee that any of the widgets in this repository will make it upstream.**

vxexp tracks the latest version of [vaxis/vxfw], and tries to upstream widgets or other changes
where possible. Upstreamed widgets will eventually be removed from vxexp.
